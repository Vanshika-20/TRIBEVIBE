### E- marketplace for tribals
### **A brief summary**

### **DOMAIN**
Web Development
### **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Create an e –Marketplace (Like Amazon, flipkart) wherein tribals can promote, market and sell tribal produce such as handicrafts, arts, paintings, minor forest products etc. on line with provision of delivery and e-payment and promotional discounts and Bidding.
### **MOTIVATION**
The tribals always have been misguided and tricked when it comes to selling their valuable indigenous products. So we believe in a time like this one, in the middle of a global pandemic , it is the need of the hour to build a safe and transparent retail marketplace for livelihood development of thousands of tribal households.
We believe in celebrating tribal craft,culture and lives.Thus we provide a safe and transparent online platform that is easily accessible and is very customer-friendly.
